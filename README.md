# MouseMacroCreator
A simple macro / scripting language and interpreter primarily used for simulating mouse and keyboard actions, this is solely being developed to increase my skills in various areas of C++

# Getting Started
Head over to the releases page and download the latest interpreter binary.  
You will need to extract the interpreter from the `.7z` file.  
To execute a created macro, simply drag and drop the macro file onto the interpreter to open it.  

> [!NOTE]
> An installer / file extension association tool is in development, there will be more info here once its ready.   

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Macros must have the file extension '.mmc'
